The `genericDataProcessing` was developed by Sonoma Technology. It is used for generic processing tasks of AQS data for use in
EPA network dashboards (NCore, Continuous Carbon, PAMS, Near-Road, etc).

This package can be installed from github using the `install_github()` function from the _devtools_ package.

```
devtools::install_github('sonomatechDS/genericDataProcessing')
```

Documentation for each function can be viewed in RStudio using `?`.

e.g. `?<function_name>` will load the function documentation in RStudio's Help viewer panel.
